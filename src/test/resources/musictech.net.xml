<li><em>Connections</em> Clock out, 2 x CV, 2 x Gate, 2 x Mod, Expression, Sustain, Footswitch, 3 x MIDI, USB</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">N</span>ovation’s new SL MkIII is designed to be the perfect partner for whatever type of studio you use. The company is touting it as the ’absolute’ hardware controller which can ’easily integrate hardware with your DAW’, and so it comes with 64 Templates set up in such a way as to control pieces of current and vintage gear. Then there are the extras.</p>
<p class="p1">The stand out is an 8-track sequencer derived from the one on Circuit (surely one of the easiest bits of hardware to produce music with) but this can be used to sequence all of that external gear together. There’s a fully-featured arpeggiator, a single Clock to rule all of your studio, plus LED feedback on your keys like NI’s Komplete Kontrol. Top DAW integration includes a focus especially on Ableton Live, although there’s also ’deep integration’ with most others.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, you get all the hardware connections you could need for all the MIDI and modular gear you could own. It’s a controller keyboard, yes, but it’s also like some kind of overseeing school master (keyboard), helping connect your parts, looking after them and getting them all working together. But can it really be all things to all producers?</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s an SL (slightly)</h2>
<p class="p1">For a keyboard range to last in excess of a decade is rare in music technology but Novation’s SL range has been with us for the best part of 13 years. The new MkIII on test here bears very little resemblance to those early models but could be as revolutionary as the Automap technology that figured so heavily in its ancestors.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that really was revolutionary; controllers that automatically mapped their actions to whatever software – DAW or plug-ins – you loaded up. It was the first serious almost AI-like interaction between hardware and software. And it’s not in SL MkIII. Instead Novation has designed this keyboard from the ground up so that it’s not being restricted by its past, but focusing on the present and the more hardware-orientated studios of today.</p>
<p class="p1">There are two models: the 61-note on test here and a 49-note for £539.99. They are not the cheapest controllers but, as Novation says, they come with a lot more than just control. Also, around half-way through my testing, I experienced a ’Eureka’ moment when I realised that maybe you should consider SL MkIII essentially as an eight-part multichannel controller, with an eight-track sequencer thrown in. Suddenly that price doesn’t look so steep…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65052" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii@1400x1050.jpg" alt="Novation SL MkIII" width="1400" height="1050" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii@1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii@1400x1050-107x80.jpg 107w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii@1400x1050-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii@1400x1050-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii@1400x1050-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>In use</h2>
<p class="p1">On unboxing, you almost get a feel for where the money has been spent straight away. There is a plethora of buttons, knobs and faders. The keyboard itself feels very well built, the screens and LEDs are lovely, the dials feel solid and the buttons are all responsive. The keyboard itself might disappoint ’proper’ players – it’s a little spongy and flat to me – but you wonder if an 88-note weighted option might be around the corner, as they so often are.</p>
<p class="p1">What I absolutely love – and it’s a ’why doesn’t every manufacturer do this?’ moment – is the rubber padding beneath the keyboard, which keeps it firmly in place and protects your work surface. I can’t tell you how many screws beneath keyboards have scratched (OK, not very appropriate) work surfaces on which I have placed them. This thing will sit on your desktop – appropriate or not – and not budge. All other companies take note!</p>
<p class="p1">The second thing I love is how stunning SL MkIII looks in operation. The five screens are lovely and work beautifully with the rotaries above; the pads beneath are similar, if not the same, as those used on Circuit so light up in different colours depending on operation (light blue for note on in the Sequencer Mode, Red to delete etc).</p>
<p class="p1">The LEDs above the keys – yes, very much a nod to Komplete Kontrol – are also a brilliant addition: white when you hit a note, red if you want to delete one in a sequence; blue in normal operation. Overall, the keyboard is a joy to look at and I almost guarantee you’ll think the same when you power it up. It will slot very nicely indeed into any of the many scenarios it is designed for, just on looks alone.</p>
<p class="p1">Now I’ll look at each of SL MkIII’s main parts, the first being external control.</p>
<h2>Hardware control</h2>
<p class="p1">SL MkIII is designed to control via MIDI and CV but, brilliantly, it uses a Template system which includes set-ups for controlling key pieces of gear – Novation’s own synths, naturally, plus a good range including Elektron, DSI, Access, Moog and more. When you select these, the keyboard automatically sets up its rotaries and sliders to control key features and parameters in that hardware.</p>
<p class="p1">The KEY POINT here – and I’ve capitalised that to get your attention – is that SL MkIII allows you to access eight of these Template destinations, or parts, at any one time. Press a button here on Destination 1, play a Moog, press 2, tweak a DSI filter, and so on. That means you can also sequence up to eight destinations together, and apply any arpeggiation to different synths, all just by selecting different Templates/parts. Think about that.</p>
<p class="p1">Up to eight external pieces of gear all controlled and sequenced from one keyboard simultaneously, but ultimately you can control a lot more simply by changing Templates. And as you’ll see when I discuss the Zones mode, you can also <i>play</i> up to eight different destination Template parts at the same time if you divide the keyboard up into eight parts. This is quite an unheard-of level of control over a complete studio.</p>
<p class="p1">In operation, to set each Template up, press Shift and the Sessions button to enter Template Mode to select which piece of hardware each track controls. SLMk II displays also things here like the output destination (MIDI, CV/Gate) and you can change MIDI channels CV channels here.</p>
<p class="p1">I happened to have a Roland TR-8S in for testing – the very first Template on my screen, as it turned out – and the rotaries automatically control parameters including tuning, decay and effects, while the sliders control drum part volume levels. It seems a little weird producing drum sequences on one hardware sequencer when the hardware in question has its own sequencer, but what SL MkIII brings to the party is access to that machine’s innards from one place and also access to loads of other gear.</p>
<p class="p1">But it’s not just hardware. Connect SL MkIII up to your DAW – via one of the eight Destinations being set to ’MIDI’ – and it will control its soft synths too and truly unite your DAW and hardware worlds.</p>
<p class="p1">So this one keyboard can control, automate and sequence each part of a hardware and DAW studio with Templates making the process smooth and automatic. Whether you’re controlling banks of Eurorack gear or specific hard and soft synths and drum machines, SL MkIII can be at the centre of it all, simple as that.</p>
<hr />
<h4>The SL MkIII controlling your studio</h4>
<p><strong>1. Controlling external gear</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65054" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-1@1400x1050.jpg" alt="Novation SL MkIII controls" width="1400" height="1050" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-1@1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-1@1400x1050-107x80.jpg 107w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-1@1400x1050-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-1@1400x1050-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-1@1400x1050-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>The big draw of SL MkIII is its ability to control and sequence up to eight external destinations via Templates. Think of them as eight tracks if you like.</p>
<p><strong>2. Selecting a template</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65053" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-2@1400x1050.jpg" alt="Novation SL MkIII controls" width="1400" height="1050" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-2@1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-2@1400x1050-107x80.jpg 107w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-2@1400x1050-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-2@1400x1050-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-2@1400x1050-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>SL MkIII ships with several Templates including Novation’s Circuit which it shares some design features including a similar-style Sequencer.</p>
<p><strong>3. How easy is that?</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65055" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-3@1400x1050.jpg" alt="Novation SL MkIII controls" width="1400" height="1050" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-3@1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-3@1400x1050-107x80.jpg 107w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-3@1400x1050-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-3@1400x1050-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sl-mkii-controls-step-3@1400x1050-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>Use the on-board sequencer to record patterns via 16 pads, then switch to another Template (in this case a DSI OB6) to sequence that! Easy!</p>
<hr />
<h2>The sequencer</h2>
<p class="p1">Now for the sequencer. Again, this is straight out of Circuit but it is eight parts in size, so everything I’m about to tell you can be applied to each of those eight parts or destinations. That means you can sequence up to eight different external destinations simultaneously with one clock to keep everything perfectly in sync.</p>
<p class="p1">The Sequencer breaks down into Step and Pattern Modes. In Step Mode you get a familiar cycling around 16 steps. Press play and each of the 16 pads lights up white as the sequencer cycles around. Press a pad and your note to record it; press the pad again and the note lights up red on the keyboard and press it to delete (or use the Clear button to the left). You can also simply record notes into a Pattern by playing them manually with the keyboard – simply hit the red Record button and play as it cycles.</p>
<p class="p1">This all becomes brilliant in operation when you want to edit note velocity, gate (length) or how the Pattern plays. Hit the Options key to access all of these. The first two screens show Velocity, Gate and Pattern options. You then hit the soft key beneath each and the screens show rotaries to adjust the velocities or step lengths to adjust the gate length on the pads/notes that have been recorded. I’m making it sound complicated but, trust me, it’s beautiful in operation.</p>
<p class="p1">The third option here, Pattern, simply lets you play around with how your sequenced pattern plays. You can randomise it, make it play backwards and adjust the start and stop position – pretty inspiring when you come up with something unexpected.</p>
<p class="p1">Patterns can be chained together or simply triggered manually in Patterns Mode which turns the 16 pads into Pattern triggers rather than individual note/steps. Here it’s very easy to get complete songs going as you can, for example, simply hold down two Pattern pads to chain them together.</p>
<p class="p1">Expand View shows the Patterns vertically in an 8&#215;8 grid so you can quickly explore larger songs. I did get a little lost here at first as there is no indication – a pad colour change, for example – showing which slots contained recorded info.</p>
<p class="p1">I should also add with the sequencer that there is full automation available with up to eight controls – rotary pads and so on – can be recorded per track.</p>
<p class="p1">The best complement I can pay the Sequencer is that it is as easy to use as Circuit’s. Yet it can do so much more, especially when you start building music across its eight tracks, working with all that external hardware and software. Brilliant.</p>
<h2>More control</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve banged on about the Sequencer and Templates a little too much but, in that, I’ve also shown how good SL MkIII controls and sequences external hardware, so now let’s look at how it works with your DAW. Here, select InControl and you should be on your way to ’seamless integration’ with Pro Tools, Cubase, Reaper, Logic, Reason and Live. When you first select it, it will be in HUI mode, that is the standard control mode that offers some control over certain DAWs including Cubase and Pro Tools. The manual gives a good rundown of how to set each up, but it’s pretty standard stuff.</p>
<p class="p1">The integration goes somewhat deeper with Ableton Live, the latest version (10.0.4) of which comes with an SL MkIII template and should auto set up. Once it does, and InControl picks up Live, it’s really something to behold. The screens list all the soft synths you have loaded in your Live tracks and set themselves up as those tracks. You can access soft synth parameters as you could with the hardware, via Templates.</p>
<p class="p1">The Pads play and mute each of the Clips and you navigate across your whole song set using up/down/left/right arrows on SL. The 16 pads are also velocity-sensitive and auto set up to play Live’s Drum Racks which is fantastic. Then you solo, mute and arm tracks with the buttons to the top right. It’s all quite amazing and the depth you can go to is something else!</p>
<p class="p1">In Logic I then tried an early beta template and had mute, solo, channel faders, and pans working no problem. Pressing the Options button and then Smart option, I was then given access to eight mappable controls on screen and was quickly controlling some of the main parameters on ES2, so this was a pretty fulsome experience all round.</p>
<p class="p1">Expect at least this native plug-in control with the newer Logic template that will be available by the time you read this. The same level will be offered with Reason but not the HUI-based DAWs which will require some MIDI learning, but plug-in control is very do-able with all DAWs apparently.</p>
<hr />
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65046" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii-front-panel-detail@996x858.jpg" alt="Novation SL MkIII, front panel details" width="996" height="858" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii-front-panel-detail@996x858.jpg 996w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii-front-panel-detail@996x858-93x80.jpg 93w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii-front-panel-detail@996x858-300x258.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/novation-sl-mkiii-front-panel-detail@996x858-768x662.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>ARP, zones, scales &amp; LED</h2>
<p>I now quickly need to touch on the Arpeggiator, Scales and Zone features. The latter two, especially, are where the LED colours on the keyboard really come into play. Zones allows you to set up to eight different keyboard zones, shown on the keyboard in different colours. Set each Zone up with a different destination and you can then use the keyboard to play, for example, eight different external pieces of hardware at the same time.</p>
<p>Better still, bring the Sequencer in and record the drums from a Live Drum Rack and the bass from your soft synth, then branch back out and play hardware! Zones, combined with the Sequencer are the highlight features on the SL MkII – indeed a highlight in music technology! It’s where it comes together; what SL MkIII is all about: sequencing, controlling, hard and soft, and all with complete ease.</p>
<p class="p1">Next up, Scales lets you select a different scale from 16 different types (and, yes, Bebop Dorian is included, before you ask). Then you can select a root note and this is shown brightly lit on the keyboard, with all other notes in the scale dimly lit so you know which ones you can safely play – a very useful learning tool and there’s even a Filter which switches off ’wrong’ notes so you can’t play them!</p>
<p class="p1">The Arpeggiator is my last main focus. You can choose from seven different arpeggiator types with up to 16 notes cycling around the pads on the keyboard which can be muted and unmuted as it cycles. There are plenty of note editing options but, again, the best part here’s that you can send the arpeggiation to different destinations so if you have your eight parts set up to different pieces of hardware, you can try out an arpeggiation on each.</p>
<p class="p1">Sadly you can’t have different arpeggiations running simultaneously to different bits of gear, but you can have the same one triggering each synth which is very cool for auditioning. What you can also do, brilliantly, is then go into Scales and start playing perfectly in-tune chord progressions with arpeggiations in whatever scale you want. Instant trance Mixolydian-style!</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, phew, all Sessions – that is complete Sequences, Patterns and Template set-ups – can be saved on the keyboard or backed up to the Novation Components website where new Templates can also be created and sent to the keyboard.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="p1">Way back when I heard about SL MkIII, I thought I would focus on the software control side of SL MkIII as that is really where previous models in the SL range were focused, particularly with that AutoMap technology. However, what really comes out of this test is that SL MkIII is more about the hardware; well, more about your studio. Those Templates really do make controlling, sequencing and automating your studio a breeze, you might even – <i>whisper</i> – move away from your DAW and completely into the hard environment.</p>

<p class="p1">But I’m making that soft/hard distinction mistake again, because really the best thing I can say about SL MkIII is that it smashes those barriers down. Rather like Komplete Kontrol was a game-changer for making you turn away from your computer for controlling software, so SL MkIII is a game-changer for sequencing your hardware and software away from or, indeed with your computer! SL MkIII is genuinely the most exciting piece of tech I’ve reviewed all year. Incredible.</p>
<h2>Do I really need this?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Novation is aiming SL MkIII at three types of user: the DAW user who has one or two pieces of choice hardware, the studio owner who has a whole bunch of hardware synths, and the live player who needs to control a load of hardware synths and effects on stage. Are any of those people you? </span><span class="s1">Of course, otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this magazine. </span><span class="s1">So SL MkII clearly has your name on it, but whether you absolutely need it really depends, as always, on your current set-up and how pleased/pissed off you are with it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are frustrated by how little your stuff gets on, how little your software seems to gel with a large hardware rig, then this could be the one ring to rule it all. And don’t forget the sequencer angle too. One annoyance I still have is booting up the computer when I have inspiration only for an annoying delay between interface and DAW ’talking’ to one another. The sequencer on this thing is instant and will get your ideas moving fast!</span></p>

<p>Arturia has released Pigments, a polychrome software synthesiser that may just alter the way you create music.</p>
<p>Arturia is no stranger to breaking the mould. Since 2003, the company has been striving to digitally recreate legendary analogue synthesisers. Its first venture, the Modular V, rose to critical acclaim, and 15 years later, Pigments may very well do the same.</p>
<p>The new product features a twin synth engine, allowing you to mix virtual analogue and wavetable oscillators to lay the foundation for your patch. Morphing wavetables and importing your own are a cinch, too.</p>
<p>What next? Well, that’s entirely up to you. With a keyboard panel, a trio of envelopes and LFOs, multiple customisable functions, randomisers and twin combinators, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<h2>T7V key features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>U-ART 1.9&#8221; ribbon tweeter</li>
<li>Polypropylene 7&#8221; woofer</li>
<li>HPS waveguard</li>
<li>Rear firing bass reflex port</li>
<li>Power RMS 70 watts</li>
<li>Frequency response 39Hz-25kHz</li>
<li>Size (h x w x d in mm) 347 x 210 x 293</li>
<li>Weight (kg) 7.1</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A </span><span class="s3">few months ago I reviewed Adam Audio’s T5Vs, the smaller of the company’s entry-level monitors. They impressed me – and everyone else who heard them – greatly, performing astonishingly well and offering unbelievably good value for money. Adam has been at the forefront of active studio monitor design for many years, with its larger – and vastly more expensive – monitors employed by many state-of-the-art facilities, including the world-famous Abbey Road Studios.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keen to hear what the larger of the two entry-level T series monitors have to offer, I now have before me the T7V. Measuring 347mm x 210mm x 293mm (HWD), it’s only slightly bigger than the T5V and is also to be used as a nearfield monitor. The main difference between the two monitors is the woofer; the T7V uses a 178mm (7&#8243;) unit as opposed to the 127mm (5&#8243;) unit in the smaller model – the clue is in the names.</span></p>
<h2>Same tech, lower price</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Common to both models is the 48mm U-ART ribbon tweeter, made from a pleated polyamide film, which draws air into and out of its folds as it expands and contracts. This Accelerated Ribbon Tweeter is a new design for the T series, incorporating trickle-down technology from Adam’s more costly ranges. It’s a wonderfully efficient design, moving air four times faster than conventional dome tweeters and extending to 25kHz. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The trickle-down benefits don’t stop there however, as the tweeter’s HPS waveguard behaves the same as that used in the company’s flagship S series. The waveguard assists high-frequency dispersal, ensuring a smooth, even response and allowing a wide sweet spot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An active design, like most studio monitors these days, the T7V’s cabinet houses two PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) amplifiers, one each for each driver. These switching amps are a Class D design, </span><span class="s1">pumping 50 watts into the woofer and 20 watts into the tweeter, making use of power transistors, producing a maximum SPL of 110dB per pair.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65040" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/adam-audio-t5v-single@1400x1050.jpg" alt="Adam Audio T5V" width="1400" height="1050" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/adam-audio-t5v-single@1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/adam-audio-t5v-single@1400x1050-107x80.jpg 107w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/adam-audio-t5v-single@1400x1050-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/adam-audio-t5v-single@1400x1050-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/adam-audio-t5v-single@1400x1050-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Class D is often thought of as digital amplification, however that’s not the case. The T7V’s amplifiers are highly efficient solid state designs, running much cooler than Class A or Class A/B amps; that’s why no heat-sinks are built into the cabinets.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The cabinet is acoustically optimised to reduce unwanted reflections, featuring a bevelled front panel that adds to the visual appeal of the monitor as well as ensuring excellent sound dispersal. It’s well-built too, with a tough, durable finish capable of taking the odd knock. The rear panel provides XLR and RCA phono input connectors along with a continuously variable volume control and switches for both high and low EQ filters.</p>
<p class="p1">The filters offer +/-2dB of shelving equalisation, though in our studio control room the T7Vs sounded best flat. As they have a rear firing bass reflex ports, some users might find the low shelf cut useful if the monitors are sited close to a rear wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Listening tests</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Firing up the Adams and playing some familiar material, I was immediately reminded of what impressed me so deeply about the smaller T5Vs. The treble response is superb, sounding clean and fast with plenty of presence and air. Transients are reproduced with trip-hammer precision yet the presentation is unforced and natural sounding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The larger mid/bass driver provides greater extension, reaching down to 39Hz as opposed to the T5V’s 45Hz, giving greater authority to bass guitar, for example. This was noticeable when playing The Beatles’ <i>Come Together</i>, a favourite test-track of mine. The bass tone on this track is quite swampy and the T7Vs had no trouble reproducing it smoothly with none of the mid-bass hump that’s often dialled into smaller monitors. The stereo mix of this track is quite wide with the guitar panned </span></p>

The stereo mix of this track is quite wide with the guitar panned extreme left and drums panned extreme right, showcasing the T7V’s panoramic imaging skills.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Playing David Bowie’s <i>Ashes To Ashes</i>, which I’d also tried on the smaller Adams, I noticed greater depth of sound-stage, the T7Vs having an almost holographic quality. This cavernous character is something of a double-edged sword, being quite inviting and seductive, yet also robbing the monitor of immediacy and some midrange punch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Bowie track is a multi-layered production and, while I enjoyed the explicit detailing and deep bass, the snare drum lacked the impact it usually has and the lead vocal sat slightly further back in the mix. This effect is quite mild however – image depth was one of the most impressive qualities of the T5V – yet the larger monitors didn’t manage to pull off this sonic trick quite as seamlessly as its smaller brother.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Switching between the T7Vs and our regular ATC monitoring systems (SCM100A mains and SCM25A mid-fields), showed the Adams to be basically tonally accurate, with only the faintest hint of bass bloom. Many users will prefer this presentation as it more faithfully mimics the sonic character of much domestic audio equipment; these users would likely find the smaller T5Vs a little lean.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Timbral accuracy is highlighted when tracking and shaping the tone of individual sources, whether by microphone selection or processing audio. The human voice is perfect for assessing the accuracy or character of any piece of equipment as we are so familiar with it in real life, and via the T7Vs it’s easy to hear the distinct character of different microphones with various voices. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The smooth, velvety midrange of our valve Neumann U67 is ideal for intimate, close-mic’d vocals whereas our brighter, edgier AKG C414 suits strident rock and pop vocals better. Similarly, the T7V’s capabilities dynamically are demonstrated when compressing bass guitar, revealing the rumbling bottom-end levelled out nicely to create a solid foundation with punch and clarity throughout the octaves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speaking of these monitor’s low-end response, while the T7Vs have fulsome bass that reproduces the lowest notes of a bass guitar faithfully, its physical size does not allow for subsonics. This isn’t a criticism though; no loudspeaker with a seven-inch woofer is going to reproduce a seismic low-end. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately for producers of music with warp-factor bass, Adam offers a range of subwoofers for, in their own words, ’lower bass – not louder bass’. Their SUB7 is designed for smaller monitors while the range comprises several models more suited to larger control rooms or workstation environments.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the entire reviewing process, the T7Vs impressed with their detailed, incisive treble and generous, full-bodied bass. Midrange accuracy and transparency is fine by any standards but it really is exceptionally good at this price point. The T7Vs image well, presenting an incredibly wide, expansive sound-stage rather than pin-point focus of individual instrument placing across the stereo spectrum, while image depth is cavernous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The smaller T5Vs offer more seamless integration between the two drivers; however they make up for it with a more usefully extended bass response. Maybe it’s the lower crossover frequency of 2.6kHz that makes the treble a tad more obvious and exposed. Both of Adam’s T range nearfields offer great value for money, punching well above their weight. Audition both if you can to hear which presentation better suits your monitoring requirements.<br />
</span></p>
<hr />
<h2>Do I really need this?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Choosing a set of monitors that work for you is one of the most important music making decisions you’ll<br />
ever make, and we always recommend you buy the best you can afford. While there are many brilliant performers costing four-figure sums, trickle down technology from Adam’s more prestigious ranges means you get a high percentage of the top models’ performance with the T range.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some nearfield designs – such as the recently reviewed <a href="https://www.musictech.net/2018/07/avantone-announce-cla10-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avantone CLA10</a> based on the legendary Yamaha NS10 – work best in the context of a more comprehensive monitoring systems. The Adam T7Vs however, are good enough to perform as the main monitors in most smaller recording set-ups. A wide and deep sound-stage coupled with excellent detail and insight make the T7Vs an ideal choice for budget conscious buyers with high demands.</span></p>

<p>Powered by Re-Compose’s trademark music intelligence algorithms, the I2C8 is a new plug-in that unlocks endless possibilities for chord sequence generation.</p>
<p>If you find yourself stumped when it comes to creating chord sequences on the fly, the I2C8 may just be the perfect plug-in for you. With its intelligent algorithms and user-friendly interface, you’ll be able to create and edit chords, explore chord sequences, and even trigger them through an external MIDI keyboard.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick glance at the functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create Chords:</strong> The I2C8 uses a simple pattern language for the definition of chords. Select a pattern symbol, and it generates a chord as well as a set of eight alternative chord sequences for the chosen pattern of symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Chords:</strong> Click on a specific chord to manually change the chord symbols. When you do so, the music intelligence algorithms will create a new matching chord progression.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Sequences:</strong> Clicking on one of the chords allows you to explore alternative chord sequences for your current pattern of symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger Chords:</strong> If you so choose, you can use a keyboard or an external MIDI keyboard to manually trigger the chords in the progression. Taking things a step further, duration and volume of your input are used to create dynamic variations to the chord progression.</li>
</ul>
<p>The I2C8 is compatible with the following DAWs: Ableton Live 9 and later, Bitwig Studio 2, Cubase 9.5, FL Studio 12 (VST, not VST3), Logic Pro X, Studio One 3, and Cockos Reaper.</p>

<h2>System 500 key features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete Eurorack System solution</li>
<li>Eurorack standard throughout</li>
<li>Original System comprises 512 VCO, 521 VCF, 530 VCA, 540 LFO/Envelope and 572 FX; £339 each</li>
<li>Four new modules, 510 Synth Voice £389; 505 VCF £349; 555 Lag/S&amp;H £349; 531 Mixer £389</li>
<li>Exclusive Roland Eurorack 84HP case (power included)</li>
<li>Inspired by the System 100M/700</li>
<li>Collaborative design with Eurorack company Malekko</li>
<li>Many of the modules offer dual functionality</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">O</span>k, I’ll confess! We’ve all made mistakes in our lives, one of mine being that I regrettably sold two cabinets of Roland System 100M, as I was finding that it didn’t fit in with my workflow. With that wonderful sense of hindsight, I immediately regretted the sale and wished I’d kept hold of them, not least of all because of the rising prices of classic kit. So when Roland announced that it was resurrecting the spirit of the 100M in Eurorack form, it was all I could do to stop myself from rocking backward and forward with utter excitement.</p>
<h2>Production time again</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What followed next was a pretty long period of waiting, which was apparently down to the lengthy production process. The design and manufacture of the original System 500 was a collaboration between Roland Japan and Eurorack company Malekko, based in Portland, USA. Such is Roland’s attention to detail, that modules were said to be flying between the two, in varying states of production and fine tuning, and you can well imagine that this did nothing to help production lead times. It wasn’t that long ago, then, that the original complete system became available, and this is where we’re going to start our tour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The original modules are available individually or as a collective, which is what we have on review here, fitted in Roland’s own Eurorack case, sized as a single row of 84HP. The five modules don’t quite fill this, so there is an included blanking plate which is bizarrely fitted, leaving a single 1HP space at the end. I’m not sure my Eurorack-centric OCD will cope well with this, but the good news is that the case feels reassuringly heavy, bristling with all the analogue goodness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The included power supply fits neatly into the back of the case, allowing for the user to place it flat on a desk, or in either angled/vertical positions. The included lid locks onto the front, which is great for transit, although there’s not a lot of room for patch cables, should you wish to transport in a patch ready state.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Powering up and it’s important to remember that this is a fully modularised Roland with no normalised patching, so you’ll have to reach for the included patch cables to get some sound. Starting at the front end of our patch, the 512 VCO module offers two identical and completely independent VCOs, meaning that you’ve got two oscillators for the price of one.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In both cases you have the choice of square, with wide control of pulse width, triangle and sawtooth waves. There’s also hard and soft sync, with a switched range pot and smooth fine-tune pot. The sonic sound-stamp of this oscillator is typically Roland; the square is weighty and sounds outstanding if used in a sub-oscillator capacity, as is the saw which is very bright, and the fact that you have the choice of two independent oscillators opens up plenty of prospects for classic duties and more interesting use alike.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65022" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-2@1400x1050.jpg" alt="Roland System 500" width="1400" height="1050" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-2@1400x1050.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-2@1400x1050-107x80.jpg 107w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-2@1400x1050-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-2@1400x1050-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-2@1400x1050-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One small gripe is related to the switched range pot, which appears to emit a very high-pitched blip every time it is changed. I can imagine this being an issue for many, not only as a mild irritation, but particularly if you intend to use this in a live environment, or even just in the studio, working on the fly. It strikes me that the addition of a better pot would sort this out, so it’s a little mystifying why this one got through.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moving filter-long onto our next module, and the 521 VCF has similarly paired credentials; there are two filters onboard, but in common with its influential 100M counterpart, it also offers three inputs per filter. This is incredibly useful, particularly if you want to do something as basic as using the oscillator module to offer a fundamental pitch with independent sub, as both timbre can be applied to the same filter, and still have room for a further signal, and that’s before you’ve even started on the second filter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The main filtration element here is a low pass resonant filter, with an accompanying 2-step High Pass filter. When I first heard this filter, my feelings were a little lacklustre; it’s not the most adventurous of filters, but it certainly grows on you, and it’s actually the slight fuzziness around the resonance that, with use, becomes incredibly endearing. It’s really very beautiful and typical of classic Roland kit from the early 80s, so I guess that in this respect it’s job done.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where it possibly starts to get a little unpleasant is when the resonance is overly applied, at which point there’s a large amount of pure whistle, coupled with significant low-end drop out. I guess it’s pretty faithful to its roots, but it does feel like the LPF opens wider than the 100M, working purely from memory. Given the vanilla nature of this filter, which feels 24dB in sound and architecture, some new additions would have been welcome, such as an overdrive option.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can probably guess the form of the 530 Dual VCA, offering two sides of VCA, with three independent inputs on each, with full attenuation. The flexibility of input routing is enormously useful, with a pot on each side offering a play-through facility, should you want to bypass gating and drone away. It’s also possible to flick between Linear and Exponential behaviour, and again it’s got that slightly vanilla flavour, but you definitely know that it’s a VCA from a certain age and sounds incredibly pleasing with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most useful 100M modules was the dual ADSR envelope, with included LFO, and that’s what we have with the 540 module. The controls are fader-based making it fairly unique, as not many Eurorack modules go down the fader route for ADSR control, but it also offers a number of other little niceties, such as the ability to cycle the attack and decay phases, with Serge-like tendencies.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65023" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-3@1400x862.jpg" alt="Roland System 500" width="1400" height="862" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-3@1400x862.jpg 1400w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-3@1400x862-130x80.jpg 130w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-3@1400x862-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-3@1400x862-768x473.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/roland-system-500-3@1400x862-1024x630.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thanks to a fast/slow option, it’s possible to take the cycle right up into the audio spectrum, at which point lovely timbral colours await. Each envelope offers a couple of outputs, along with an inverse shape. The LFO element isn’t lacking either, as it offers five regular wave types, along with oscillation rate under CV control. This is a real goodie; useful, useable and plenty of operational options.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So to the last of the original lineup, which offers the potential for being one of the most exciting. The FX module features Phase Shifter, Delay, Gate Delay and another LFO. The Phaser is pleasant enough, providing decent colour, with the modulation speed being dictated via the onboard LFO, but the Delay is not what you might regard as a conventional line delay, offering a very short delay time, making it far more about modulation than any form of musical delay, and in a similar guise, the Gate Delay does what it says on the tin.</span></p>
<h2>All new modular-cons</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so to the new breed, and leading the charge for new modules, the 510 Synth module offers a full synth voice, consisting of single VCO, VCF &amp; VCA. This will be a very useful module if you’re tight for space, and containing all three basic module elements does make it an enticing bargain. The same three square, triangle and saw waveforms are available within the VCO, but with a single offering of each, as opposed to a dual design seen on the 512 VCO module. The square timbre is hard-wired to the filter, with access to the other waveforms through patching, while there are two inputs available to both the filter and VCA, although they will both sum the signal to use a single incarnation of each. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The filter seems to be the same design as the 521, along with the 2-step switched HPF. Putting the module through some A/B tests with the original System 500 modules, there is little to no difference sonically between them. There is a slight difference in the play of the pots between filters, but nothing that would cause offence. As before, this is a sensibly designed module which performs well, albeit slightly safe and vanilla in sonic makeup.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if vanilla is not your thing, the 505 VCF module could well be the one that interests you, and certainly came as something of a surprise to us all, when announced. Containing a clone of the VCF from Roland’s own SH-5 monosynth, this module has some guts. The 505 offers a dual-filter design, with inbuilt VCA circuitry; VCF 1 is a selectable Low/Band/High pass filter, while VCF 2 is fixed as a Band pass filter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first thing that hits you square between the eyes is how much grunt this filter has. Apart from the ability to control cut off and resonance via CV, the interplay between both sides of the filter can be routed and separated, according to selection switches which direct the signal via one of two outputs, with an option for both outputs as well, so you can use the 505 as two filters, or combine them into a state of frenzy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are plenty of prizes to be had here; the low pass is untamed and raw, with no bottom end drop out, while the resonance has a lovely overdriven quality, which is not the same as the slightly later 101-esque-style timbre. It’s not sharp, rather gnarly and rich, but the real joy starts when you bring both sides of the filter into play simultaneously, as the sonic characteristics quickly descend into a world of beating harmony, offering both the grotesque and musical in equal portions.</span></p>
<p>Placing these elements within CV modulation creates some bewildering and wonderful effects, as everything moves around and beats against each other. Without wishing to in any way sound patronising, this is the sort of thing we want; a filter with real colour and charm, that really offers something creatively.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The final pair of modules in the new Roland lineup are pretty utilitarian, with the first offering a degree of creativity within. The 555 Lag/S&amp;H module is positively a cornucopia of gizmos, all of which could be useful at some stage. The Lag section offers two channels of portamento, with a fader for each, designating the degree of time taken between notes or CVs settling. Alongside this, the sample and hold element outputs a clockable signal, generated from a host of timbre which include white and pink noise, alongside another five traditional subtractive waveforms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A further LFO is also on hand, with independent outputs for each waveform, LFO delay and CV control of LFO oscillation, which is a very decent spec indeed. You’ll also find individual outputs for white and pink noise, as well as a very curious ring modulator. Regrettably, the ring mod felt unbelievably tame, and would benefit from additional controls to boost and drive the signal, to provoke some form of response. As an add-on to this exceptionally useful module, we can let it slide, but it is a real shame, and you’ll not be wanting to buy this module for the ring mod alone.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, we have a Eurorack Output Mixer, in the shape of module 531. Offering six channels of mono input, with stereo output via mini-jack, 1/4&#8243; jack and headphones. How sensible, we cry, and with the added ability to pan each channel manually, from a small pot, or via CV control. Each of the six inputs is equipped with its own fader, along with a mute button per channel, neither of which are under CV control, which seems like a little bit of a shame. Channel six also offers the additional capacity of being able to accept an input from the 1/4&#8243; jack which resides next to it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can operate at mic or line level, and will prove useful if you just want to add an external source into play. It’s a nice and really useful module, which I found exceptionally helpful during testing, allowing me to route several signals for comparison, but it’s a shame that the mute buttons have no visual indicator, to provide a clue as to position. For playing live, it’ll be difficult to see what’s going on, while the lack of CV control for anything other than panning feels like a shortcoming, and a great shame.</span></p>
<h2>The final performance</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what to make of it all? Well, I’ll confess to being a huge fan of Roland kit from the late 70s/early 80s era, which leads me to suggest that the original System 500 collection is a beautiful thing, but somewhat vanilla sonically. It’s got plenty of creative potential, but it doesn’t pack the punch that many of us might have expected. In general use, I did find some of the labelling of inputs and outputs a tad confusing, as some of the legends above and below the jack points might leave you wondering what socket does what, but that’s an issue with cramming so much into the Eurorack panel form. I also yearned for some Mults to be included in the system, like the original 100M.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dual-voice capacity of the original System 500 does help, with plenty of room for adding external signals, but it’s with the new modules that I feel that Roland is starting to get into its stride. There’s some really useful stuff here, with the new synth voice and fantastic SH-5 filter shining through alongside the new utility styled modules, and that’s where I can see the original system beginning to become more of a creative and abstract animal, with these useful additions. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></p>
<hr />
<h2>Do I really need this?</h2>
<p>The concept of buying a complete Eurorack system, from a single company, is a prospect which is open to some debate. The market is saturated with companies, small and large, many of which have plenty to offer, from regular subtractive style modules to exceptionally interesting modules which look to both create and control sound. With this in mind, the original System 500 may appeal to purists wishing to add to a collection, but for the hardcore Euro-fiend, it might not offer enough to warrant the financial outlay. However, the new modules offer plenty, from full-on synth voices to highly desirable filters and utility modules, and will happily find bedfellows in a system comprised of many parts, which is really the whole point of Eurorack.</p>

Atlantis £649</p>
<p>Thought by many to be a 101 in Eurorack form, Intellijel have brought us here a module that offers a basic structure, but with a vast range of additional CV control. Sonically great and deep. It’s even got those typically Roland-styled faders.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audioweld has revealed its designs for a wristwatch synthesiser, dubbed the Audioweld Synthwatch. The brand is touting it as the world’s first musical watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the risk of oversimplifying this clever little gizmo, the Synthwatch is a synthesiser you can wear on your wrist… that also tells time. The titanium-cased timepiece has actual keys that cater to “every kind of finger size”, Audioweld claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be played on its own – just connect it to a usb speaker – or with the Synthwatch app, which allows for more tinkering. The latter mode allows you access to over 200 sounds, a standalone, built-in sequencer and more. The app is available on Android and iOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helming the Synthwatch team is a father-son duo, Fausto and Francesco, who are both master horologists, so they know a thing or two about what they’re doing. They’ve spent two years developing this project with various engineers and creatives, and the journey in itself is something remarkable. They’re currently seeking funding on Kickstarter, so if this seems like something you’d be on board with, you know what to do.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I</span><span class="s3">’</span>ve been a long-time fan of Audio-Technica microphones – I have a number of well-used and well-loved examples in my mic cupboard. I<span class="s3">’</span>ve also heard good things about the company’s M-series headphones, so I jumped at the opportunity to check out the ATH-M60x, the latest in that product line.</p>
<h2>In the box</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The M60x’s are a closed-back on-ear headphone. On-ear headphones tend to be used less in studios than over-ear, as the latter generally gives better isolation, which reduces problems with the sound spilling to recording mics when working with acoustic instruments. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, with soft, plush memory foam pads wrapped in a supple fake leather, the M60xs create a snug fit against the ear that’s both comfortable and effective in preventing such spill. Being on-ear also makes them feel less claustrophobic during extended use, and it’s easy to get the drivers into the perfect position for your ears, as they move easily when making adjustments, but hold firmly when in use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The headphones come with three interchangeable cables: 1.2m and 3m straight cables, plus a coiled cable that stretches to a 3m limit. One end of each cable has a 2.5mm jack that fits into a socket recessed into the headphones’ left-hand driver. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The barrel of the 2.5mm jack and the barrel of the recessed socket have a twist-and-lock mechanism which fixes the cable in place and protects the socket against strain and tugs. At the other end, the cables are terminated with 3.5mm mini-jacks, although a 3.5mm-to-6.3mm screw-on adapter is also provided. All the plugs are of the corrosion-resistant gold-plated variety.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Context sensitive</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are various functions that headphones fulfill in the studio. The most obvious is as an alternative monitoring solution, either for when comparing mixes between different monitors, or when you want to work quietly and/or privately. Good headphones can also reveal sonic details that aren’t apparent when listening on full monitors<br />
(it kinda depends on how good your monitors are, of course), and by closing out external noise they can help in tracking-down unwanted and extraneous noises and artefacts in a recording.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Headphones also have a vital role to play when recording with live musicians and acoustic instruments, where they are generally the perfect monitoring system for the cue mixes fed to the musicians.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I tested the ATH-M60x’s in both of these settings – control room and live room – using them during some sessions. I also performed some listening tests using a range of different material, containing different frequency makeups and sonic properties; with a frequency response reported as 15Hz to 28kHz I expected to get good results here. </span></p>
<h2>Sounding off</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The clarity of the sound is unquestionable, with a crisp and sparkling top-end, detailed mids and a tight, well-balanced low end. However, I did feel there could be more definition in that lower end, and that it deserved to be deeper and richer given the stated low frequency response.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More noticeable was a pronounced peak at around 2kHz which added a harsh edge to most material. This can be dialled-out if your headphone signal path has some EQ available to it, which is what I did, but you could also become familiar with the peak so as not to be mislead by it when performing critical reference work with the M60xs.</span></p>
<h2>Cutting through</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whilst this peak may be a nuisance in a control-room setting, in the live room it proved to be the opposite: I used the M60x’s for cue mix monitoring during a vocal session, and here that 2kHz peak helped the direct-monitored vocal signal to cut through nicely, thereby allowing the monitoring level to be kept comparatively low. This made for a much more comfortable singer, which in turn made for some really good takes. The lower monitoring level also meant that the spill from the headphones, which is well-controlled anyway, was further reduced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The M60xs also work well at higher volumes &#8211; retaining their crispness and clarity even when the volume approached painful levels, making them ideal for drum sessions and full band sessions too. Given this ability to deliver very high SPLs, it’s handy that the M60xs feature a built- in limiter, capping the peak signal level at 105dB.</span></p>

<h2>Overall impressions</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ATH-M60x headphones are rugged and feel well-built, yet are lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods – more-so than claustrophobic (and often sweaty) over-ear designs. The M60xs also suffer from less spill than many other on-ear headphones, and so are a viable alternative to over-ears even when recording quieter instruments like acoustic guitars and vocals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tonal characteristics of the headphones may impact upon their usefulness in the control room, and even though this can be easily mitigated it’s still disappointing in headphones that cost £179 – not the most expensive cans by any extent, but not cheap either. However, those tonal characteristics work in their favour in a live room environment where their vocal presence peak, crisp sound and clarity at higher volumes makes them an excellent choice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They also serve as a highly recommended choice of listening headphones: if you&#8217;re in need of some late-night inspiration or sample-browsing, then these &#8216;phones are well equipped for the task, or even just to kick back and listen to some records and/or movies. However, of course, that&#8217;s not our usual angle of review. But it&#8217;s worth noting.</span></p>
<hr />
<h2>Do I really need this?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All studios need at least one pair of headphones, and these are worthy contenders. The build quality is excellent and they’re comfortable to wear. They deliver a crisp sound, although lack a depth at the very low end. A presence peak at around 2kHz needs to be dialled-out if using these cans for reference work in the control-room, but in the live room that presence peak can be beneficial, especially when tracking vocals, which cut easily throug</span><span class="s2">h the cue mix.</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">S</span>pire Studio is a standalone or iOS multitrack recorder that aims to bring back the golden days of mobile multitrack recording. Remember those happy days of bouncing tracks down when you were limited to just four tracks? A time when limitations actually aided your creativity?</p>
<p class="p1">OK, maybe you’re not as old as me, and while iZotope’s Spire Studio has the same ’instant recording’ ethos as those early cassette multitrackers, there’s a lot more to get your teeth into to create very high quality recordings, should you wish. Add a free app on and you really have got a recording studio in the palm of your hand.</p>
<h2>Eight in a tube</h2>
<p class="p1">What you get with Spire Studio is a chunky cylinder-shaped box that I wouldn’t describe as particularly mobile in shape – it’s hardly pocket-sized – but it does feel rugged enough to be taken out and about. It contains a 360º omni-direction microphone and two mic/line, combi XLR/jack inputs for plugging in, well, pretty much anything you like.</p>
<p class="p1">Connecting an external instrument or mic into socket one disengages the front microphone for a cleaner recording, while if you use input two, you can record whatever you plug in there – an acoustic guitar, for example – and the on-board mic at the same time.</p>
<p class="p1">Around the top edge is a series of LEDs that indicate several things including the number of tracks you have recorded (shown in different coloured segments), your input signal level and your output volume level. Completing the connections you get a couple of useful headphone outs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-64993" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-record.png" alt="iZotope Spire Audio Record" width="394" height="700" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-record.png 800w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-record-45x80.png 45w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-record-169x300.png 169w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-record-768x1366.png 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-record-576x1024.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></p>
<p class="p1">On the top of the unit are Record and Play buttons, a New Song button, Soundcheck and Volume. Soundcheck, combined with the LEDS, is a particularly useful function as pressing it gives you around eight seconds to play in your maximum vocal, guitar or whatever signal level, and then Spire Studio sets its input recording level up accordingly, to be able to handle whatever you throw at it.</p>
<h2>In use</h2>
<p class="p1">As a standalone recorder, things couldn’t really be that simpler with Spire Studio. Simply press New Song, record and sing or play away into the microphone. The quality is surprisingly good just using the on-board mic, although you can plug a higher quality one in should you wish. You set the level with the aforementioned Soundcheck, hit record, play your tune, then hit record again, and your first track is stored, and then shown ’moving’ around to the right on the LED indicators.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-64992" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-mix.png" alt="iZotope Spire Audio Mix" width="394" height="700" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-mix.png 800w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-mix-45x80.png 45w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-mix-169x300.png 169w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-mix-768x1366.png 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-mix-576x1024.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></p>
<p class="p1">As you record track by track, these build up in different colours to the maximum of eight. It’s not immediately obvious how to then recall different songs that you have recorded – there are very few other on-board controls and the instruction manual (such as it is) make no mention of it – so for this you are really steered towards using the app. But this is really where Spire comes alive, so it’d be churlish not to use it.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a free iOS app (on the iZotope website, it states Android too, but then retracts that, so we tested Spire Studio with the iOS app!). Under Record mode, the app displays all the audio you have recorded as waveforms running left to right, and, just like the audio tracks in your DAW. OK, it’s not as detailed as the audio in your DAW but you are able to clean up your recordings by deleting certain parts either left or right of the current play position.</p>
<p class="p1">Where the app works really well is for simple mixing and panning under the Mix window, where you have all eight of your parts displayed on screen to drag left and right (pan) and up and down (volume) very easily. You can also easily mute tracks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-64994" src="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-tempo-576x1024.jpg" alt="iZotope Spire Audio Tempo" width="394" height="700" srcset="https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-tempo-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-tempo-45x80.jpg 45w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-tempo-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-tempo-768x1366.jpg 768w, https://www.musictech.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/izotope-spire-audio-tempo.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></p>
<p class="p1">There are some great on-board effects that can be used when recording (not on older recordings you have made, though) which are very good for livening up acoustic guitars and vocals, in particular. Finally, in Tempo mode, metronome and manual tempo adjustment features give you a good audible guide when making these recordings. In general, the app makes Spire Studio very easy to use, and you could also use it minus the hardware to make simple recordings, although you’d be at the mercy of your phone mic.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Spire Studio is a great, rugged device that allows you to make fast and good quality multitrack recordings as a standalone unit. Teaming it up with the app and you have a fantastic partnership that allows you to get your musical ideas down quickly, and export all the stems you record to wherever you want.</p>
<p>As such, if you are a studio-based producer who finds yourself on the road and in need of something for when those moments of inspiration strike, then Spire is a great option, especially if you don’t like risking taking your laptop with you to make such recordings.</p>
<p>I’d also say it’s a good choice if you are an aspiring singer-songwriter. It is perhaps a little pricey for what it is ultimately, but it is also very easy to use and pretty mobile so really does bring back some of that multitrack mentality we had ’back in the day&#8217;. All in all, Spire is a simple portastudio for the 21st century and a pretty inspired bit of kit.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Do I really need this?</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have a decent home studio set-up then, no, Spire is not essential. However, if you are totally new to music making and don’t fancy the complexities of DAW recording, then Spire, along with the app, makes recording a breeze. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ll be limited to eight tracks until you take the plunge and open the DAW route, but it’s a great scratchpad to get you started. Where Spire is really inspired is for the travelling musician with too many song ideas in their heads. </span><span class="s1">It can suck up all your riffs, melodies, beats and moments of inspiration quickly and easily, so if you are one of these people who has maximum ideas when away from your studio, Spire could be the sponge you need. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alesis has launched the Strike Multipad, which is a percussion pad with an arsenal of effects for the modern drummer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick glance at the Strike Multipad will tell you that it’s no ordinary electronic drum pad. Stacked with 32GB of storage with over six GB of content – including loops, drums and percussion, and melodic instruments – it’s pretty far from ordinary. Still not impressed? The Strike Multipad also doubles up as a two-in/two-out USB audio/MIDI interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite such comprehensive functions, the new device is relatively easy to use. Sampling is made simple with a built-in sampler that allows you to record via USB, smartphone, microphone or any other audio device of your choosing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of performance, the Strike Multipad features nine velocity-sensitive pads with customisable RGB lights, which come in handy on dark stages. The device also has multiple built-in effects processors: three kit effects, a master effect, a compressor and an EQ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all of that isn’t enough, the Strike Multipad also allows you to supersize your setup with external triggers and pedals: three external drum/cymbal triggers, two dual foot controls, and a hi-hat pedal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The device ships an exclusive version of Pro Tools | First &#8211; Alesis Edition and Ableton Live 10 Lite. </span></p>
